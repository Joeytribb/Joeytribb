# 👨‍💻 Iniyan Andrews Joseph
## AI Researcher | Financial ML & Multimodal Agents

### 👨‍💻 I’m a developer exploring how AI can automate complex, creative, and decision-intensive workflows — from 📈 quantitative trading systems and 🎮 game environments to 💬 conversational agents.

My work sits at the intersection of Machine Learning and Complex Systems, with particular emphasis on Reinforcement Learning for autonomous decision-making and Multimodal LLMs for interactive systems. I build projects from scratch and iterate aggressively, combining theoretical rigor, interpretability, and systems-level thinking to move beyond black-box models toward robust, deployable intelligence.

## 🎯 Research


## 1) 📈 [HOPE - Probabilistic Stock Screening System](https://github.com/Joeytribb/HOPE)
> **Question**: Can simple linear models outperform Deep Learning in short-term volatility prediction?

A comparative analysis of ML architectures for predicting short-term alpha in high-volatility markets.
*   **Key Finding**: Linear Regression **outperformed LSTM and Random Forest** by achieving a **70% Win Rate** and **190% Return** in backtests, demonstrating that model simplicity often generalizes better in stochastic financial environments.
*   **Tech Stack**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `Linear Regression`, `LSTM`.
