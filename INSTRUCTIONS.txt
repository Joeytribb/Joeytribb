# How to Publish Your Profile

1.  **Create the Repository on GitHub**:
    *   Go to https://github.com/new
    *   Repository name: **Joeytribb** (Must match your username exactly!)
    *   Description: "My Research Profile"
    *   Public: **Yes**
    *   Initialize with README: **No** (You already have one)

2.  **Push this Folder**:
    Open a terminal in this folder (`Joeytribb_Profile`) and run:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Research Profile"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Joeytribb/Joeytribb.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

3.  **Verify Links**:
    *   I have set the project links to `https://github.com/Joeytribb/PROJECT_NAME`.
    *   Ensure your other repositories (`HOPE`, `bithax`, `Jaguu`, etc.) are public and named exactly as they are in the links.
    *   If a repo has a different name (e.g., `my-trading-bot` instead of `Ohh`), edit the `README.md` here to match the URL.
